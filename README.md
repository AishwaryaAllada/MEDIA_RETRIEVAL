A SCALABLE CONTENT BASED VISUAL MEDIA RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
========================================================

Our research proposes a novel, efficient and scalable content based visual media retrieval system. We focus on creating an comprehensive architecture by leveraging the power of Deep Learning to enable modularization and efficiency for various retrieval applications that require scalability as their key requirement. 
The proposed novel architecture is flexible to work for both images and videos conjointly. 

#### We also put forward the results of two important experiments
1.the impact of colors on retrieval tasks
2.fast comparison techniques that may have a considerable impact in improving retrieval tasks further.
